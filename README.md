# Ruby_Toolbox
A Collection of Tools I have used for a variety of projects.

** This file was never intended to be ran by itself. **
** It was inteded to be loaded by irb with 'irb -r path_to_file' and used in an interpreter**


You will notice a lot of extremely small functions here that are mainly used for the following:
  1. Providing easier coding which is based on habits from other languages (Python Helpers)
  2. Automating certain tasks
  3. Providing functions that would rarely, if ever, be used in a production program.
     These functions and classes are aimed for use in an interpreter, for testing or debugging.

You are more than welcome to send suggestions for new functions/classes, as well as constructive and technical criticism.
The overall goal of these tools is to assist all programmers with using Ruby. Including those coming from Python, C, etc.

No idea is too small, or too big. 
The larger the idea is, the longer the list of reasons it would help programmers should be.


This collection will always be a work in progress. Just as the Standard Library is always being updated.
